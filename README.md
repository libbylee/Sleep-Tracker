## Sleep Tracking Journal 

*Why am I making this?*
As a student, it can be hard to get the correct hours of sleep and be able to say definitively how many hours of sleep you've gotten.
That's why I decided to create a sleep tracker journal, where one can track the hours of sleep they have been getting to stay healthy. 
In addition, I'd be able to log my dreams and rate the quality of sleep I've had. Did I wake up in the middle of the night? Did I sleep
through my alarm? Any student will understand the struggle of not being able to sleep well. If I am more informed about my own sleep quality,
I will be able to make healthier decisions. 

*My journal will include:*
- Ability to log the number of hours slept
- Ability to rate your sleep quality
- Ability to track your dreams 
- Ability to go back on each date and view previous entries
- Ability to add up the total number of hours you've slept/ average hours 

#### My X and Ys: 

- X = hoursSlept Y = totalSleepingHours
- X = diaryEntry Y = diaryEntries
- X = qualityofSleep Y = sleepRatings 


#### What I want to be able to do as a user:
- As a user, I want to log the total number of hours I've slept for a certain day
- As as user, I want to be able to rank my sleep quality
- As a user, I want to be able to log my dreams as a diary entry
- As a user, I want to go back on each date and view previous entries
- As a user, I want to be able to see a summary of the total number of hours/ average hours I've slept
