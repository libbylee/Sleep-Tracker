## Sleep Tracking Journal 

*Why am I making this?*

<br>

As a student, it can be hard to get the correct hours of sleep and be able to say definitively how many hours of sleep you've gotten.
That's why I decided to create a sleep tracker journal, where one can track the hours of sleep they have been getting to stay healthy. 
In addition, I'd be able to log my dreams and rate the quality of sleep I've had. Did I wake up in the middle of the night? Did I sleep through my alarm? Any student will understand the struggle of not being able to sleep well. If I am more informed about my own sleep quality, I will also be able to make healthier decisions. 

*My journal will include:*
- Ability to log the number of hours slept
- Ability to rate your sleep quality
- Ability to track your dreams by writing a note  
- Ability to go back and view all entries
- Ability to see the average sleep rating + number of hours you've slept
- Ability to sort sleep entries by highest rating and highest sleep quality

#### My X and Y: 
- X = sleepEntry Y = sleepJournal

#### What I want to be able to do as a user:

##### Add multiple sleep entries to a sleep journal:
*As a user, I want to be able to log multiple sleep entries to my sleep journal over time so that I can track my sleep patterns on different days.*

##### List all sleep entries in the journal:
*As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all sleep entries in my sleep journal that I have added so that I can easily review and compare my sleep history.*

##### Log total hours slept and sleep quality for a specific date:
*As a user, I want to log the number of hours I slept, rate the quality, as well as add notes of my sleep for a specific date so I can track how well I’m sleeping each night.*

##### Sort sleep entries by ratings and number of hours slept 
*As a user, I want to be able to see the entries in which I have had the highest number of hours of sleep and the highest ratings of sleep.*

##### View average sleep hours and quality:
*As a user, I want to be able to see the average hours I’ve slept and the average sleep quality of my entries, so I can analyze my overall sleep patterns and make adjustments if needed.*

##### Save SleepJournal:
*As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my to-do list and have the option to do so or not.*

##### Load SleepJournal:
*As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my sleepJournal*
